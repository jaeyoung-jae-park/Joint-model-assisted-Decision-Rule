# Can a joint model assist target label prediction? Conditions and approaches


## Requirements

No requirements if you run the code in Google Colab. The code works properly when using Google Colab and Google drive, so we strongly encourage you to use Colab. Otherwise, you need pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, and keras. 

## Table of contents

Each jupyter notebook has the same table of contents.

- Data preparation
--- Data loading
--- Label setting
- Hyperparameter settings
--- Baseline
--- NN and NN-joint
--- CIDNN
--- Joint-model-assisted linear/nonlinear decision rules (LDR/NLDR)
- Training
- Evaluation

## Data preparation

The guideline of how to download and load the datasets in the paper is described. The label setting also is decribed.

## Training

Once loading the dataset is done, run all the codes in the section of Hyperparameter settings. Then, run the code in the section of Training, following the guideline in the jupyter notebook.


## Evaluation

To evaluate the models, run the code in the section of Evaluation, following the guideline in the jupyter notebook.
